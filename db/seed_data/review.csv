It is so useful,4,1,
I can't get enough of it,2,1,
I can't wait to recommend it to a friend,5,1,
It was absolute wookie garbage,1,2,
Really cool! I converted mine into headphones May the Force be with Carrie Fisher our Princess Leia lives on in our hearts.,5,2,
I'm not sure about this one. This a very cute headband. My daughter is going to be Princess Leia in a week long event this summer and I am nervous about the quality of these head bands. They look great but they don't feel like they will last a whole week,4,2,
What can I say about the Princess Leia Headband for Adults that hasn't already been said about the wheel penicillin or the iPhone,5,3,
Princess Leia was bought for my husband's Potato Head collection. She never comes out of the box but is quite happy to be with all the others spuds.,4,3,
You need to have a taller barrel chested dog to pull this off.,3,4,
The product is awesome. Great for photos and Halloween. I have a Cavalier King Charles and normally she wears a Medium however this item was really long on her. I'd recommend going with a size smaller than the sizes they published. She is 18lbs and the arms hit the floor when she was sitting.,4,4,
Quite long for my frenchie was not a good fit. But super cute costume!,2,4,
I'm pretty happy with this shirt. Fun 70's vibe that's an adultish Star Wars tribute.,4,5,
Crappy ripped after wearing in once.,1,5,
It's made with cheap plastic that cracked when it fell from the basket under our stroller to the sidewalk.,1,6,
My granddaughter who's 6 loves Star Wars and anything to do with it. She loves playing with it because it lights up makes the lightsaber sound and disappears completely into the handle. She thinks it's the real thing and I'll never tell her different,5,6,
LOVE IT,5,6,
My son saved up his own money to buy this product. There were several different options of lightsabers. Cost wise this one was the middle. It's a great toy for my 5 year old. My 8 year old is saving to buy one now too. The light saber retracts down to a small handheld size sword. When you swing it expands to full size. At times it gets stuck either expanding or retracting but can easily be consolidated by trying again. There are no small parts to worry about. There's also no noises other than what my son makes when he plays with it. He runs around the house swinging it and has it the ground stuffed animals and walls a few times. The product has held up to his rough housing perfectly. Overall I'd say this is a nicely made product for the price.,4,7,
This Star Wars The Force Awakens Kylo Ren Extendable Lightsaber is a sturdy and dependable plastic toy that can really take a beating,5,7,
These are a ton of fun! My son and daughter each have a color of choice and they are getting a ton of use out of them. Great quality product!,5,8,
This is a great product good quality material. I would recommend it to others to buy it.,5,9,
I really want to give this 5 stars for the mask alone it's five stars. But...it's got the voice changing feature too which would be totally awesome but it's not loud enough. If you trigger the canned prerecorded responses it's ok but speaking it's not. Would I recommend this? Yes I would because it's a worthwhile mask but you might be able to find one cheaper that has the same effect without the voice changing feature.,4,9,
great replica mask and was the hit of our Halloween celebration especially with the kids!,5,9,
You'll want it to rain! Does this really need a review? It's a lightsaber AND an umbrella! The batteries are included so you can use the Force right away.,5,10,
The umbrella is a fantastic item that I love playing with in and out of the rain. The central shaft that lights up blue really gives it a lightsaber feeling while still being just the right size for both my hands and my young cousin's hands. The canopy once opened is an excellent width allowing you walk unhindered through the elements as if you were using the force to shield yourself from the rain. The umbrella also comes with a carrying sleeve that fits the entirety of the umbrella to the lightsaber hilt with a strap that allows you to carry it on your shoulder and be the envy of other Jedi and Sith.,5,10,
As as Star Wars nerd...this thing is sweet. Haven't tried the voice modulator and i doubt i will just gonna sit on my shelf proudly! Fits my head just fine after adjusting the inside bands to the max setting. Anyone with a larger than medium head might have problems getting this helmet on or worse..off. Looks fantastic snaps together in 3 pieces and sits pretty flush.,5,11,
This helmet looks extraordinarily authentic and comes in at a very reasonable price particularly when you compare it to other helmets at more than double. It's really easy to put together. The voice feature is novel but it's rather impractical you have to put the microphone almost in your mouth for it to pick up your voice. I prefer to use it with the batteries out. As I wasn't looking for a voice changing feature this attractive helmet satisfies my wants.,5,11,
Looks very cool fits extremely awkward. Gets lotsa wows on display. But, I can't really see where I'm walking with it on. It bobbles around and no matter how I've tried adjusting the plastic bands inside it still fits uncomfortable. A decent buy for the price for a toy replica. But this is definitely anywhere like real movie prop replica unless they all fit weird.,3,11,
Great product but the sizing is a little off. We ordered a medium for a 20lb pug and it fits our 52lb pit bull better.,4,12,
This is very poorly made with unfinished seams and flimsy material that would not last on most dogs. The arms do not hang in any sort of realistic way as they do in the picture nor does the head cap look as clever. As one reviewer pointed out it is difficult to figure out how to get it on and no instructions are provided. I will use it for a themed party once but then it will go straight to Goodwill.,2,12,
The costume is cute but definitely runs big.,3,13,
Loved this on our husky got an extra large and it was perfect. Supper cute! Love the dark side!,5,13,
My fiance and I are having a Star Wars and Lord of the Rings themed wedding. We wanted to include our little buddy in the wedding so of course he'll need to be dressed appropriately While there don't seem to be a lot of Hobbit or Gollum costumes for dogs there sure are a lot of Star Wards doggie outfits. I bought 2 to try out- these Jedi robes and the Ewok one. The Ewok one definitely didn't fit right but these Jedi robes fit PERFECTLY on our little dog!,5,14,
My dog didn't care for it at first but she's gotten used to it. She looks adorable in it. Only wished it came with a small lightsaber to go with it.,5,14,
Good costume. Great costume for a fancy dress party but must wear shorts underneath as very short!,4,15,
It has a tons of sounds including Help me Obi One Kenobi! You're my only hope and he's so cute!,5,16,
Oh My God! The best Star Wars toy ever! R2is so adorable! I've been hunting for him for months and all I could find was extremely expensive. Finally I got my hands on R2 and never let go!,5,16,
Head keeps falling off. The Magnet is not strong enough.,2,17,
So much fun!!!! The head falls off when it hits something but is easily placed back on,5,17,
I bought this shirt for my husband and it is gorgeous in person. The gold on the shirt is metallic foil and has an amazing shine.,4,18,
The fit is perfect true to size and the colors are fantastic.,5,18,
Shirt is too long,1,18,
What's not to love about a BB8 Backpack!,5,19,
It is hands down the coolest backpack and contemplating purchasing another one.,5,19,
my daughter loves it!!,5,19,
This is my favorite shirt ever!,5,20,
Meh its alright,3,20,
Worst shirt ever.,1,20,
